Multi Canvas:
- The functions from the canvas-utils.js can be easily modified to work with a single canvas, rather than a universal one. This can be useful for the multipage functionality.
- Multipages should be dynamic. New canvas per page. Requires universal changes to how we use canvas. Probably switching to a list canvas = []
- Need to add Page button. Page (1/x), Page (2/x) and s on.


Labs:
- Embolden the Titles of each Lab.
- Clear up the Show Summary and useless buttons.

Necessary UI Things:
- "Universal Formatting Buttons (B I -)" (Bold, Italics, and so on). Can map the buttons the add the points **, _, - around the highlighted text.

Templates:
- Add Extra Fields to the MAR template, particularly next to the title.
