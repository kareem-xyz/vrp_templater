Multi Canvas:
- The functions from the canvas-utils.js can be easily modified to work with a single canvas, rather than a universal one. This can be useful for the multipage functionality.
- Multipages should be dynamic. New canvas per page. Requires universal changes to how we use canvas. Probably switching to a list canvas = []
- Need to add Page button. Page (1/x), Page (2/x) and s on.


Labs:
- Embolden the Titles of each Lab.
- Get a reference for Labs from Koury or Caughey. Populate the labs.json with that.
- Clear up the Show Summary and useless buttons.
- Get info from Koury about what shortcuts do they want. Just Normal vlaues or something else?
- Fix: Checking one lab should not enable every other checked lab.


Necessary UI Things:
- "Universal Formatting Buttons (B I -)" (Bold, Italics, and so on). Can map the buttons the add the points **, _, - around the highlighted text.
- "Add Field" button to the labs.html and index.html. This one should requires a simple modification. Can probably be imported from the builder.js files.
- "Add Textbox" button too.

Templates:
- Add Extra Fields to the MAR template, particularly next to the title.
