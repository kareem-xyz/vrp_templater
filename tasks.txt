Multi Canvas:
- The functions from the canvas-utils.js can be easily modified to work with a single canvas, rather than a universal one. This can be useful for the multipage functionality.

Labs:
- Embolden the Titles of each Lab.
- Clear up the Show Summary and useless buttons.

Necessary UI Things:
- "Universal Formatting Buttons (B I -)" (Bold, Italics, and so on). Can map the buttons the add the points **, _, - around the highlighted text.

Templates:
- Add Extra Fields to the MAR template, particularly next to the title.


Logic:
On some button press, or perhaps height crossing border of multipage textbox.
copy the current canvas object into the canvas div.
use the process pages function to return just the text that is enough for the first canvas, and the new canvas.
append the canvas. DO NOT download them. Simply keep them there, and add new canvas to an array.
Change the download canvas function to download an array of canvases, displaying a modal that contatins hyperlinks for each download. (Not pressing it instantly.)
